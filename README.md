# World Population Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze various factors related to the world population using Python in Google Colab. The dataset used contains information on population, temperature, IQ, education expenditure, stability, and birth rates across different countries.

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Temperature and Birth Rates

- **Hypothesis**: Maybe the higher the temperature, the higher the birth rates.
- **Approach**: We will explore the correlation between temperature and birth rates across different regions and analyze whether warmer climates contribute to higher birth rates.

### Hypothesis 2: IQ and Stability

- **Hypothesis**: Maybe the higher the IQ, the higher the stability.
- **Approach**: We will investigate the relationship between IQ levels and stability indices in various countries. This analysis aims to determine whether there's a correlation between intelligence quotient and societal stability.

### Hypothesis 3: Education Expenditure and Stability

- **Hypothesis**: Maybe the more spent on education, the more individuals become stable.
- **Approach**: We will examine the impact of education expenditure on societal stability. By analyzing the education expenditure per inhabitant and stability indices, we aim to understand the relationship between investment in education and societal stability.

### Hypothesis 4: Stability and Birth Rates

- **Hypothesis**: Maybe the higher the stability, the higher the birth rates.
- **Approach**: We will explore the relationship between stability levels and birth rates across different countries. This analysis will help determine whether societal stability influences birth rates.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
